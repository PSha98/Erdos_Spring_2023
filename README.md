### We combined structural modeling and machine learning to customize pricing for new listings in LA. 

Our approach considers various factors such as property locations, amenities, host ownership, substitution between nearby listings, etc to maximize the hostâ€™s profit. The structural model captures supply & demand dynamics and machine learning helps identify consumer consideration sets (hotspot markets). We also use machine learning for price prediction to utilize rich features better.  

### Our project not only identifies the popular hotspots through K-means clustering but also provides insights into the rate of return for each hotspot. 
The following graph right-hand side displays the clustered regions, with each area colored based on the rate of return. It's important to note that the graph on the left-hand side displays the market by default neighbourhood which might not accurately represent the consumer's actual consideration set.
