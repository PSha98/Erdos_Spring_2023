## How to make money in LA with Airbnb? 
### We combined structural modeling and machine learning to customize pricing for new listings based on property locations, features, ownership, and substitution between nearby listings to maximize the hostâ€™s profit. The structural model helps capture supply & demand dynamics and machine learning helps capture consumer consideration set (hotspot market). We also use machine learning for price prediction to utilize rich features better.  Furthermore, we recommend areas with the best rate of return for potential hosts and suggest possible amenities to become popular in Airbnb.
